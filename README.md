# 🔐 DataSentinel

A secure backend CRUD system built with a focus on **data access security**, **user action logging**, and the efficient use of **Dapper** — a lightweight ORM for .NET.

This project simulates a real-world **vehicle parking management system**, showing how Dapper can be used to simplify database interactions without sacrificing code control and performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to build a vehicle parking management system using **Dapper**, a lightweight and high-performance ORM for .NET.  
It explores how Dapper simplifies data access in relational databases while keeping the code clean and efficient.

The project also introduces best practices in secure CRUD development, with user access logging and token-based authentication.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- 🧠 C# (.NET 6)
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL
- 🚀 Dapper ORM
- 🔐 JWT Authentication
- 📋 Access Logging (User + Timestamp + Action)

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔒 Secure login and token-based auth
- 🚗 Parking CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- 👤 Audit trail: logs of all user actions
- 🛠️ RESTful API following clean architecture principles
- 🧪 Easy-to-extend and test

## 🚧 Status

> ⚠️ This project is currently under development.  
I'm using it as a learning platform to better understand secure backend architecture and Dapper's real-world usage.

---

## 📚 Learning Focus

This project helps me explore:

- How to integrate Dapper in an organized C# solution
- How to create secure login systems with JWT
- How to implement logging mechanisms for audit purposes
- How to structure a backend with clear separation of layers
